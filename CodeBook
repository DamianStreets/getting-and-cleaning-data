OVERVIEW
The data in this project is sourced from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

From the above: 

      The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
      
      The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

STRUCTURE OF DATA FILES
The dataset is then divided in two parts and they can be used separately. 

    1. Inertial sensor data 
    - Raw triaxial signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope of all the trials with with participants. 
    - The labels of all the performed activities. 
    
    2. Records of activity windows. Each one composed of: 
    - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
    - Its associated activity label. 
    - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

VARIABLE UNITS OF MEASURE

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. 
- Each feature vector is a row on the 'X' and 'y' files. 
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2). 
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg. 
- A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: [Web Link] 

STANDARD DEFINITIONS AND MEANS

The project only extract the Standard Defintions and Means from the larger data set. This returns 68 variables.  

Variable names have been updated for the sake of clarity with the t prefix being replaced by time and the f prefix replaced by frequency
